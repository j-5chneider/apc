How are open access APCs distributed over publishers and publishing models?  
How many hybrid or full OA journals can I afford with a certain amount of money?

## The app
...will allow you to interactively plot the APCs of publishers and their publishing models. Choose 

* what to plot on the x-axis (publisher, publishing model)
* what to differentiate by color (publisher, publishing model)
* where to set your APC-limit (to see how many APCs you can afford)

Simply dowload the R project and run the `dash.Rmd` file.

## Raincloud plots
We used [raincloud plots](https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots) in the app. Show some love for: Allen M, Poggiali D, Whitaker K et al.

## Datasets taken from
[retrieved: Dec 21st 2019]  

This is a dashboard that plots the APCs of four publishers:

* Elsevier
* Springer Nature
* DeGruyter
* Wiley

I "randomly selected" these publishers simply because I found downloadable data sheets of their APC rates for Hybrid and Full Open Access journals. If you are aware of other easily accessible data sets, let me know.
